---

## üöÄ Before the Exam

### 1. Technical Setup

Ensure all students have:
- [ ] Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- [ ] Working internet connection
- [ ] Access to the exam URL: `/lecture4/lab-exam`
- [ ] Cleared browser cache (or use incognito for fresh session)
- [ ] Basic understanding of Express.js and Git

### 2. Pre-Exam Briefing

Inform students about:
- 90-minute time limit with auto-submit
- Device-locked sessions (cannot retake on same device)
- Hint system and point deductions
- Code editor interface and tools
- Git requirements (conceptual, shown in hints)
- Passing score requirement

### 3. Test the System

Before exam day:
- [ ] Navigate to exam page and start a test session
- [ ] Verify timer countdown works
- [ ] Test hint reveal functionality
- [ ] Check code editor responsiveness
- [ ] Verify test code button works
- [ ] Confirm submit and scoring work correctly
- [ ] Test session persistence (refresh page)

---

## üìã During the Exam

### Monitoring

1. **Time Management**
   - Exam auto-starts when student clicks "Start Exam"
   - Timer is visible at top of screen
   - Red pulsing alert when < 10 minutes remain
   - Auto-submit at 0:00

2. **Student Assistance**
   - **Do not** reveal bugs directly
   - **Can** clarify general concepts
   - **Can** help with interface issues
   - **Cannot** debug their specific code
   - Direct students to use hints if stuck

3. **Technical Issues**

   **Browser Crash/Refresh:**
   - Session is automatically restored from localStorage
   - Timer continues from last saved state
   - Code is preserved

   **Session Issues:**
   - Session ID is unique per device
   - Cannot be transferred to another device
   - To reset: clear localStorage or use different browser
   ```javascript
   // To manually clear session (instructor console):
   localStorage.removeItem('labExamSessionId');
   localStorage.removeItem('labExam_[sessionId]');
   ```

   **Cannot Access Exam:**
   - Verify correct URL path
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Try incognito mode for fresh session

---

## üìä Grading Rubric

### Automatic Scoring System

The exam automatically grades based on 7 test cases:

| Test Case | Points | What It Checks |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Middleware Order | 15 | `helmet()` before `cors()` |
| CORS Configuration | 10 | `cors({ origin: '...' })` present |
| Health Check Status | 15 | Returns 503 on error condition |
| POST Endpoint | 15 | `/api/data` route exists with `req.body` |
| Error Status Code | 15 | Error middleware sets `res.status()` |
| Listen Error Handler | 15 | Handles EADDRINUSE with `.on('error')` |
| Module Export | 15 | `module.exports = app` present |
| **Subtotal** | **100** | |
| Hint Deductions | -10 each | Up to -30 points |
| **Final Range** | **70-100** | |

### Grade Scale

| Score | Grade | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 90-100 | A | Excellent |
| 80-89 | B | Very Good |
| 70-79 | C | Good |
| 60-69 | D | Passing |
| 0-59 | F | Failing |

## üîç Reviewing Student Results

### Accessing Results

Students see results immediately upon submission:
- Overall score (X/100)
- Pass/fail status
- Individual test results
- Hints used and deductions
- Session ID for reference

### Interpreting Results

**Perfect Score (100):**
- Fixed all 7 bugs correctly
- Used no hints
- Demonstrates mastery

**High Score (80-99):**
- Most bugs fixed
- May have used 1-2 hints
- Strong understanding

**Passing Score (60-79):**
- Fixed essential bugs
- Likely used all hints
- Adequate understanding

**Failing Score (<60):**
- Missing critical fixes
- May need review session
- Consider remedial work

### Common Mistake Patterns

1. **Middleware Order (15 pts)**
   - Student often forgets security-first principle
   - May not understand middleware execution order

2. **CORS Config (10 pts)**
   - Students miss the security implication
   - May think `cors()` alone is sufficient

3. **Status Codes (15 pts)**
   - Confusion about when to use 200 vs 503
   - May not understand HTTP semantics

4. **Missing Route (15 pts)**
   - Students might overlook the requirement
   - Shows reading comprehension issue

5. **Error Handling (30 pts total)**
   - Both error middleware and listen errors
   - Shows understanding of robust error handling

6. **Module Export (15 pts)**
   - Often forgotten
   - Critical for testing and modularity

## üìù After the Exam

### 1. Review Session (Recommended)

Hold a class review covering:
- Each bug and why it's important
- Best practices for Express.js
- Common mistakes observed
- Security considerations
- Professional error handling

### 2. Individual Feedback

For students who struggled:
- Identify specific knowledge gaps
- Recommend resources
- Offer practice problems
- Consider retake policy

### 3. Exam Analytics

Track across all students:
- Average score
- Most missed test cases
- Hint usage patterns
- Time completion statistics
- Pass/fail rate

**Example analysis questions:**
- Which bugs were most commonly fixed?
- Which bugs were most commonly missed?
- Did students who used hints perform better?
- Was 90 minutes adequate time?

---

## üîß Customizing the Exam

### Change Difficulty

**Make Easier:**
```javascript
// In LabExam.jsx
const EXAM_DURATION = 120 * 60 * 1000; // 120 minutes
const HINT_PENALTY = 5; // Reduce penalty
```

**Make Harder:**
```javascript
const EXAM_DURATION = 60 * 60 * 1000; // 60 minutes
const HINT_PENALTY = 15; // Increase penalty
// Add more complex bugs to buggyCode
```

### Add New Test Cases

```javascript
// In testCases array
{
  id: 8,
  name: "Rate limiting middleware present",
  test: (code) => {
    return code.includes('rate-limit') || code.includes('rateLimit');
  },
  points: 10
}
```

### Modify Hints

```javascript
// In hints array
{
  id: 4,
  title: "Your New Hint",
  content: "Your hint content here..."
}
```

## üìû Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### "Student can't start the exam"
- **Check:** Browser compatibility
- **Check:** JavaScript enabled
- **Solution:** Use Chrome/Firefox, clear cache

#### "Timer shows negative time"
- **Cause:** System clock change
- **Solution:** Refresh page, timer recalculates

#### "Code not saving"
- **Check:** localStorage enabled
- **Check:** Not in private browsing
- **Solution:** Enable localStorage, use regular browser

#### "Session already exists"
- **Cause:** Previous attempt on same device
- **Solution:** Clear localStorage or use different device
```javascript
// In browser console:
localStorage.clear();
```

#### "Scoring seems incorrect"
- **Check:** Review test case logic
- **Verify:** Student code against solution
- **Note:** Scoring is strict pattern matching
